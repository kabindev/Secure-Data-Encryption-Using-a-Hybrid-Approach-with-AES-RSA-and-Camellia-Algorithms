**Hybrid Cryptography using AES, RSA, and Camellia**

A secure encryption framework that combines AES, RSA, and Camellia to provide multi-layered protection for text, images, audio, and video files. This hybrid approach enhances confidentiality, prevents key interception, and improves resilience against brute-force and differential attacks.

Key Concepts

| Technique                  | Role                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|  **AES (CBC Mode)**      | Fast symmetric encryption for half of the data |
|  **Camellia (CBC Mode)** | Symmetric encryption for the other half        |
|  **RSA**                 | Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange  |
|  **Hybrid Model**        | AES + Camellia (symmetric) + RSA (asymmetric)  |

🧪 Simple Algorithm Overview

Key Generation & Exchange

```text
1. Receiver generates RSA key pair (public + private).
2. Sender generates AES and Camellia keys.
3. Sender encrypts these keys using receiver’s RSA public key.
```

Encryption Workflow (Sender)

```text
1. Input file → split into 2 parts.
2. Part A → encrypted with AES (CBC).
3. Part B → encrypted with Camellia (CBC).
4. Combine AES + Camellia ciphertext + IVs + encrypted keys.
5. Transmit final encrypted package.
```

Decryption Workflow (Receiver)

```text
1. Decrypt AES and Camellia keys using RSA private key.
2. Decrypt both parts using respective keys and IVs.
3. Reconstruct original file (text/image/video/audio).
```
