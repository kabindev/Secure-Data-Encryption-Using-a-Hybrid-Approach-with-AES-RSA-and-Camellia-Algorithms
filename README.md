# Secure-Data-Encryption-Using-a-Hybrid-Approach-with-AES-RSA-and-Camellia-Algorithms
This project uses a hybrid cryptographic system combining AES, RSA, and Camellia to ensure secure, efficient encryption. It merges fast data encryption with secure key exchange, offering strong confidentiality and integrityâ€”ideal for real-world secure communication and data protection.
